# üè° Intelligent Data Collection Framework for House Cost Prediction

This project presents a robust and intelligent framework to **automate house price prediction** by integrating real-time property listings, geospatial data, and multiple machine learning models. It enhances the accuracy of real estate valuations using a combination of structured web data, location context, and ensemble modeling techniques.

---

## üìå Project Overview

Traditional property valuation methods often rely on outdated data and manual analysis, which limits their accuracy and adaptability. This framework:

- Automates the collection of housing data using **web scraping**.
- Enhances listings with **geospatial data** from APIs.
- Performs **feature engineering** to extract meaningful variables.
- Applies and compares **multiple regression models**.
- Provides a **user-friendly web interface** for live predictions.

## üîç Key Features

- üóÇÔ∏è **Comprehensive Data Collection**: Scrapes property listings with size, location, rooms, type, and pricing info.
- üåê **API Integration**: Uses Google Maps API to gather nearby amenities (schools, parks, hospitals).
- üßº **Data Standardization & Cleaning**: Normalizes and transforms messy data, handles missing values.
- üìä **Advanced Feature Engineering**: Adds distance metrics, construction year, renovation year, etc.
- ü§ñ **ML Models & Ensemble Learning**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
  - LightGBM
  - Voting Regressor (ensemble)
- üß™ **Performance Evaluation**: MAE, RMSE, R¬≤ Score, log-transformed metrics
- üåç **Web Interface**: Built using Flask and Streamlit for interactive predictions
- üìà **Visualizations**: Geospatial heatmaps, feature importance (SHAP), trends
